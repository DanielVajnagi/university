        <p class="text">AlphaTauri have confirmed that Yuki Tsunoda will remain with the squad for the 2023 season, for what will be the Japanese driver’s third year with the Italian team.<br>
        Tsunoda joined the Faenza-based AlphaTauri at the start of the 2021 season, and has spent two years to date alongside Pierre Gasly, netting 43 points in that time 
        (32 of which were earned last season) alongside a best race finish of fourth – claimed at the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

        <img src="img/24races.jpg" class="news_pic">
        <p class="text">Formula 1 has announced the calendar for the 2023 FIA Formula One World Championship, which has been approved by the World Motor Sport Council.<br>
            Kicking off in Bahrain on March 5 and concluding in Abu Dhabi on November 26, the season will feature a record-breaking 24 races, with China and Qatar set to return, 
            and Las Vegas arriving as the penultimate round for a Saturday night race.<br>
            The traditional summer break will remain in August, though changes to race dates see Belgium move to the end of July as a back-to-back with Hungary, 
            while the Netherlands is twinned with Italy after the restart.<br>
            Pre-season testing has also been confirmed, and will take place over three days at the Bahrain International Circuit, from February 23 to 25.

        <h2>Ferrari boss Binotto set for talks with Schumacher over his F1 future</h2>
        <img src="img/mick_shumi.jpg" class="news_pic">
        <p>Ferrari team boss Mattia Binotto has provided an update on Mick Schumacher’s Formula 1 future, explaining that he will check in with the German during the closing stages of the 2022 season and settle 
            on a path forward.<br>
            Schumacher, 23, is contesting his second F1 campaign with Haas – who use power units, gearboxes and other components supplied by Ferrari – and is 15th in the championship standings on 12 points – 
            10 behind team mate Kevin Magnussen.<br>            
            Amid speculation over Schumacher’s spot in the Ferrari Driver Academy, and his F1 future as a whole thanks to a flurry of driver changes for 2023, Binotto made it clear that the situation will 
            be addressed across the final six rounds of the season.<br>
            “With Mick, as we said at the start of the season, it’s important for him this season to improve. We will in a few races sit down with him, make a balance of the season, and we’ll do that 
            as well together with Haas and decide his best future,” Binotto explained.<br>
            As for the wider value of the Scuderia’s dedicated Driver Academy, he said: “[It’s] a very important pillar of our team. We are investing a lot in it and we’ll continue investing a 
            lot. The reason for that is that we believe it’s important to develop the best talent and look for the future to try to find the best talent for the red car.”<br>

        <h2>Formula 1 mourns the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II</h2>
        <img src="img/queen.jpg" class="news_pic">
        <p>Formula 1 mourns the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, who passed away on September 8 at the age of 96.<br>
            Her state funeral takes place today at Westminster Abbey in London, with a national two-minute silence to be held just before midday local time as the service draws to a close.<br>            
            Leading the sport’s tributes to Queen Elizabeth II was Formula 1 President and CEO Stefano Domenicali, who said: “Formula 1 mourns the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.<br>            
            “For more than seven decades she dedicated her life to public service with dignity and devotion and inspired so many around the world. Formula 1 sends its deepest condolences to the 
            Royal Family and to the people of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth.”<br>            
            Queen Elizabeth II bestowed knighthoods on four Formula 1 drivers during her 70-year reign, with Sir Lewis Hamilton the most recent, joining Sir Stirling Moss, Sir Jack Brabham and Sir Jackie Stewart.<br>

        <h2>‘With Ferrari, everything seems bigger’ – Sainz defends Scuderia strategy team</h2>
        <img src="img/ferari_strategist.jpg" class="news_pic">
        <p>Carlos Sainz has thrown his support around Ferrari's strategy team, insisting that too much is being of their mistakes this season, and that no other team in Formula 1 faces the same level of scrutiny.<br>
            Ferrari have faced criticism for some of their strategy calls this season that have seen them potentially miss out on victories or better results. However, Sainz believes that their mistakes 
            are being overblown, while the positives go ignored.<br>            
            “I think it’s very difficult to generalise about where we should have been more brave or more cautious. I think you would need to pick one by one and analyse them independently,” said Sainz.<br>            
            “I'm pretty sure one by one, every result or every conclusion will be different. For me, it's all about continuous improvement and continuously finding ways to make the right calls at the right time.<br>            
            “And there have been a lot of times during the year where we've done the right calls and no one has come to us to say, ‘Oh, you did the right call’ or congratulate us for that.<br>            
            "But on the other hand, when there's been two or three – let's say call them bad calls with hindsight – there's been massive criticism about it."</p>

        <h2>WATCH: F1 Explained – What do all the marshals flags mean?</h2>
        <p>We often see marshals waving different coloured flags to the drivers throughout a Formula 1 race weekend, but what does each flag actually represent? Well, in the latest instalment of F1 Tv's Tech 
            Talk you can get a brief lesson on the meaning of each one...<br>
            We all know the chequered flag comes at the end of a race, but there are some lesser used ones that you might not be sure about.<br>            
            But never fear, because Formula 1’s Technical Expert Albert Fabrega is here to give us an insight into the assorted flags that the marshals wave to the drivers, and what they mean. From the green 
            flag seen at the start of the race to the red and yellow signal used to send a warning to the drivers.<br>            
            Fabrega also reveals the key difference between a single and a double yellow flag, and the meaning behind the lesser known “meatball” warning sent to a particular driver.<br>            
            BEYOND THE GRID: Timo Glock discusses his time in F1, the aftermath of Brazil 2008 and much more<br>            
            Did you know some there are some flags that the marshals can wave under their own initiative, and some some that can only be waved on instruction from the Race Director? Fabrega explains all, 
            and also gives us an insight into the keyboard panel that the marshals use, which can tell the drivers if there is rain in a single part of the track.<br>

        <h2>Verstappen takes his first-ever Italian Grand Prix win behind the Safety Car as Leclerc has to settle for P2</h2>
        <img src="img/max_monza.jpg" class="news_pic">
        <p>Max Verstappen won the 2022 Italian Grand Prix under the Safety Car, with pole-sitter Charles Leclerc finishing runner-up as Red Bull denied Ferrari a home victory at Monza.<br>
            After the paddock paid their respects to the late Queen Elizabeth II, the mixed-up grid lined up behind Leclerc and fellow front-row starter George Russell in the Mercedes, both eschewing the general 
            consensus of medium tyres to begin on new softs along with Verstappen, Williams’ debutant Nyck de Vries, and Alpine's Esteban Ocon.<br>            
            From P7 on the grid, Verstappen made it into the top three by Lap 4 and took P2 off Russell a lap later. The Dutchman then led as, during a Virtual Safety Car (for Sebastian Vettel’s DNF on Lap 12), 
            Leclerc pitted from softs to mediums.<br>            
            Verstappen extended his first stint and swapped for mediums on Lap 26, relinquishing the lead back to Leclerc, who then pitted a second time for soft tyres on Lap 33. The Monegasque driver had a tyre 
            advantage over Verstappen, but a 20-second deficit to claw back by Lap 53. The Dutchman seemed assured of a comfortable victory until a Safety Car on Lap 48, for the stationary McLaren of 
            Daniel Ricciardo. That allowed the top five to pit for softs anticipating a restart.<br>            
            Ricciardo’s car seemed immovable, however, and the ticker reached Lap 53 and the chequered flag with the field behind the Safety Car – giving Verstappen a slim but altogether comfortable victory 
            over Leclerc and allowing Russell to retain the final podium place.<br>

        <h2>Four-time champion Sebastian Vettel to retire from Formula 1 at the end of the 2022 season</h1>
            <img src="img/vettel.jpg" class="news_pic">
        <p>This is it. Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel will retire from Formula 1 at the end of the season.<br>
            The German, who made his debut with BMW Sauber in the 2007 United States Grand Prix, revealed the news via his newly created Instagram account – his first foray into social media.<br>            
            Vettel won all four of his championships with Red Bull between 2010 and 2013 and is third on the all-time list of Grand Prix winners with 53 victories.<br>            
            A six-year stint with Ferrari failed to yield a much-coveted fifth title and he has scored just one podium during one-and-a-half years with Aston Martin, where his contract expires at the end of 2022.<br>            
            Ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix, Vettel – who races alongside Lance Stroll – announced this will be his 15th and final full season in Formula 1.<br>
